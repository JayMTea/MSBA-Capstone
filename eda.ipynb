I sprinkle the apples with cinnamon sugar, and boy are those tasty. If you're into it, you can dehydrate vegetables to store and re-hydrate later on to use for soup.This model also makes beef jerky, so when I get around to doing that, I'll update this review! Seriously though, Nesco is a really well-known company and they make several different models of dehydrators. Depending on how heavy your usage, you really can't go wrong with this brand, no matter which model you decide on. I know a few people who also have Nesco dehydrators and have nothing but positive things to say about the company. My ONLY complaint is that I have no good place to store it because it's so large, but that's a personal problem, and doesn't reflect poorly on the function of the dehydrator. :-)",

The adjustable temperature control (95°F -160°F) gives you the flexibility to achieve the best results when drying different foods that need varying temperature settings. This dehydrator comes with five (13 1/2″ diameter) trays and expands up to 12 trays so you can dry large quantities at once, with no tray rotation needed. Additional Add-A-Trays sold separately. The quiet, powerful Converga-Flow fan forces heated air down the exterior pressurized chamber, then horizontally across each individual tray. The air flow then converges in the center for quick, consistent drying that is four times faster than other dehydrators. The top mounted fan eliminates liquids dripping into the heater chamber. Includes two fruit roll sheets, two clean-a-screens, a sample of jerky seasoning & cure, and a 52-page recipe & instruction book. Make delicious jerky, fruit chips, dried herbs at a fraction of the cost of store bought. The NESCO FD-75PR Snackmaster Pro Food Dehydrator ensures even drying from top to bottom offering perfect results.']",

         "Hubs insisted on this coffee pot over the more traditional shaped percolators available. Why, you ask? Well, it just looks cool on the countertop. That said, the program function works great and he wakes up to fresh, hot coffee every day. I think the only downside to this product, if you can consider it a downside, is that since the carafe is so...well....ROUND, you have to tip it almost completely upside-down to pour out the last of the coffee. It doesn't spill or anything, it's just a little...awkward. Hence the removal of the 5th star on the review. If you can deal with the slightly awkward pouring of the carafe, then you have yourself a sleek and winning coffeepot that does what it promises - brews a heavenly cup of joe. Enjoy! (Side note - a friend came over this morning, took one look at the coffeepot, and said &#34;what is THAT?!&#34; in wide-eyed wonder). Haha!",

         "I wanted a small, inexpensive entryway shoe rack, and that's what I received. It's not the best quality, and the cubbies are very small, but it works for what I wanted. My nursing shoes barely fit in one cube together, and my running shoes have to be in separate cubbies (as well as all of my husband's shoes). However, I knew this from previous reviews, and was OK with it. It's not worth a 5-star review, but since I knew what to expect, I wasn't really disappointed with it either. If you want something more sturdy (aka made out of real wood) and with better \"shoe holes\", you will pay more for it. If you don't have a gajillion large pairs of shoes, this product will probably work fine for you. I can fit 2 pairs of my size-6 summer sandals/flip flops in one cubby. Don't expect this thing to perform magic - it really is rather inexpensive compared to the other options out there.",
